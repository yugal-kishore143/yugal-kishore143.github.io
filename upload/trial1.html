                    In this company our best labor is the engineers and the builders. The engineers we hire are dominant and can take the responsibilities easily. They con supervise the builders easily and can explain them how the building will come up using simple words in the local language with ease. The builders are also equally skilled and efficient. Both the labor classes cooperate and work peacefully which decreases the time of building the house. They use high tech tools to build the building which improves the quality of the building and its strength. We build a strong foundation for the buildings which can protect them even if a earthquake rated 3.0 on the ritcher scale happens. The frame work of the building will be so strong that if a car moving at 80 km/h happens to crash into the building area it cannot be destroyed.<br>
